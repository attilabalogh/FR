Financial Ratios for Accounting Research

This paper and the associated code provides guidance on the appropriate calculation of financial ratios for capital markets-based empirical research in accounting and finance.
Practical examples are provided employing the widely-used Compustat database accessed though Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS).
This is the companion Github repository for the paper and the associated SAS code is made available to assist researchers in consistently calculating and applying key financial ratios.

Comments, corrections, suggestions and new ratio ideas are welcome.
All errors are my own.
